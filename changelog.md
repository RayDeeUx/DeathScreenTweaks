- Increase minimum requirements for using DeathScreenTweaks.
## v1.4.1

- Rewrote a few things in the source code.
## v1.3.1
- Fix a crash from selecting Fonts 1 through 9 (even though they're all objectively ugly). Thanks again, hiimjustin000!
## v1.3.0
- Rebrand to DeathScreenTweaks for consistency with LoadingScreenTweaks and EndscreenTweaks.
- Automatic migration of custom death messages from DisturbingNewBests.
- Rewrote a few config descriptions.
- Added option to hide the New Best screen itself, because that was apparently an attempted mod submission on the old Geode mod index.
## v1.2.0
- Port to 2.206. Big thanks to CatXus, Aktimoose, ninXout, and hiimjustin000 for helping out with testing!
## v1.1.2
- Replaced a few quotes in the default set in light of recent events.
- Replaced a few quotes in the Brandon Rogers set, because some of them were incredibly unfunny.
- A small optimization.

- A single line swap to properly enforce text alignment.
## v1.1.0
- Added linewrapping support. Thanks sofabeddd!
- Added option to hide rewards animation on death.
- Added "Max Scale" option.
- *Technically*, this is the initial release for the Geode index, but there have been several notable changes between v1.0.0 and v1.1.0 that it's best to release a new version now to make sure everyone updates to this version.
## v1.0.0
- Initial release (for GitHub).
