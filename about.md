# DeathScreenTweaks

<cy>Note: This mod *will* auto-enable the `"Just, Don't..."`/`"Do Not..."` in-game setting; it is necessary for this mod's most important feature (read below) to have a visible effect.</c>

Various tweaks to the "New Best" screen. (Formerly DisturbingNewBests.)

Features:
* Hide the rewards animation.
* Hiding the entire "New Best" screen. (For the three people who want to do that.)
* Changing the font of the "Level Complete" text message.

And now, for the big one...

Replaces "New Best" messages with slightly "better" ones, including those of your own choice.

Allows three sets of messages: a default set, custom text from the config folder, and (ad-friendly) Brandon Rogers quotes.

Custom messages defined from the `custom.txt` file within the mod's config directory will be formatted as follows: `- lorem ipsum -` in order to distinguish them from the default set of messages.

As tempting as it would be to have a regex filter to moderate messages found in `custom.txt`, this mod will not be pulling double duty by attempting to solve the Scunthorpe problem.

Quotes originated from a variety of sources, including various members of the Geode SDK Discord server, xkcd, [Brandon Rogers](https://linktr.ee/brandonbored), and Adam Neylan.
