# DeathScreenTweaks

Note: This mod *will* auto-enable the `"Just, Don't..."`/`"Do Not..."` in-game setting; it is necessary for this mod's most important feature (read below) to have a visible effect.

Various tweaks to the "New Best" screen. (Formerly DisturbingNewBests.)

Features:
* Hide the rewards animation.
* Hiding the entire "New Best" screen. (For the three people who want to do that.)
* Changing the font of the "Level Complete" text message.
* Replaces "New Best" messages with slightly "better" ones, including those of your own choice.
