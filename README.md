# DeathScreenTweaks
<c-AAAAAA>(Formerly DisturbingNewBests.)</c>\
Spices things up a bit when receiving a "New Best" screen.\
*(All mod features apply to Classic levels only.)*

## Features:
* Replaces "New Best" messages with slightly "better" ones, including your own.<co>\*</c>
* Auto-screenshots on player death.<cl>\*\*</c>
* SFX specifically for getting a \"New Best\".
* Sisyphus effect, for when dying near the same spot as your previous attempt.
* Hide the rewards animation, or the entire "New Best" screen.

## Notes
<co>\* This mod *will* try to auto-enable the `"Just, Don't..."`/`"Do Not..."` vanilla in-game setting.</c>

<cl>\*\* [PRNTSCRN](mod:ninxout.prntscrn) required. For best results, please try to set a reasonable respawn time (anything more than 0.25 seconds). This allows "New Best" animations to complete before a screenshot is taken.</c>
